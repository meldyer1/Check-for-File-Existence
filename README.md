# Check-for-File-Existence
Write a BASH script which checks for a given file. If the file exists, print "Found *fileName*" to stdout, otherwise print "Can't find *fileName*."
If no arguments are supplied, print "Nothing to find"
Examples:
file exists: 
run_shell file1.txt --> "Found file1.txt"

file doesn't exist:
run_shell file1.txt --> "Can't find file1.txt"

No arguments:
run_shell --> "Nothing to find"
